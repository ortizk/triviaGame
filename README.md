[CLICK HERE TO PLAY NOW](https://ortizk.github.io/triviaGame/home.html)


# Proposal

A one player trivia game answering 10 timed questions.

## Game Objectives

Your starting "health" is determined by a mini game before the trivia starts that has you filling your beer. You move onto the trivia portion of the game where you answer 10 timed questions. Answering questions correct increases your beer, answering them wrong will decrease your beer. You are given a status depending on your ending beer level at the end of the game.

## Instructions

 - Use your mouse to navigate through the site and answer the questions.
 
 - Use the spacebar at the bar to increase your beer. 
 



## Status/End of Game

Your status is determined at the end of the game. It is based on your beer level. 

 - Poor = Guess it's not your night
 - Medium = Not Too Shabby
 - Great = Genius Status

## Development Approach

 

 1. Creating the mini bar game: when you get to the bar, a countdown timer is started on page load and then prompts you to fill your beer by pressing the space bar. This is your health and must be carried to the trivia portion of the game by way of LocalStorage
 2. Creating an array of questions to select from.
 3.  Program the questions to be selected randomly and to be shown on the page accompanied with 4 possible options.
 4. Compare the answer that the player selected to the right answer and display if answer is right or wrong and have the beer increase or decrease.
 5.   Add timer for each question that restarts when the next question is displayed. If time runs out, the question is counted as wrong.
 6. After 10 questions have been answered, determine status




## If I had more time...

 - Add the option for second player
 - Levels of difficulty
